The primer is intended to refresh language features for `C`/`C++`.  A previous
class taken for either language or experience gathered through other means is
assumed.

## Schedule and Location

Location: **SEC LL2.224 SU Family Classroom**

Time: **6:30PM - 7:30PM**

Date:
* 10/18 - 10/22 (week 42)
* 10/25 - 10/29 (week 43)

_**Meeting times:**_  The mini-class takes place during calendar **week 42 and
43**.  Lectures are held on each week day (Mon-Fri) from **6:30PM - 7:30PM**
(depending on discussions during the lectures, you may need a bit of additional
padding regarding the 60 minute duration).

### Lecture Content

Lectures 1-4 discuss basic concepts that were first introduced in `C`.  Lectures
5-10 focus on `C++` specific language features that are not available in `C`.
