# IACS `C`/`C++` Primer

This is the public repository for the IACS `C`/`C++` primer.  The primer
consists of 10 lectures covering the basics of `C` and `C++`. The class is
intended to refresh these languages.  A previous class taken for either language
or experience gathered through other means is assumed.

## Schedule and Location

Location: TBD

Time: **5:00PM - 6:00PM**

Date: TBD


### Lecture Content

Lectures 1-4 discuss basic concepts that were first introduced in `C`.  Lectures
5-10 focus on `C++` specific language features that are not available in `C`.

-->

#### Lecture 1
* Procedural languages and Object Oriented Programming / General overview
* Compiled languages / Stages of code compilation / Get to know your compiler
* Building code / `make` / `meson` / `cmake`
<!-- * How to organize code in files / Headers, circular inclusion and header guards / Compilation units -->
<!-- Notes:
* Book recommendations
* cppreference.com

#### Lecture 2
* Basic built-in types
* Arrays
* Pointers
* Pointers are not arrays
<!-- Notes:
* built-in types: discuss integer division, floating point precision, machine
  epsilon
-->

#### Lecture 3
* Pointers and dereference operator
* References (`C++` specific)
* Basic operators and operator precedence
* Functions and function pointers

* Stack and heap
* Input/Output (IO) / Streams

#### Lecture 5
* Object Oriented versus Data Oriented designs / Where is `C++` good at and
  where can it hurt you
* Classes: Constructors / Initializer lists / Destructors / Members / Attributes
* Access modifiers

#### Lecture 6

* Operator overloading
* Inheritance and the `this` pointer

#### Lecture 7
* Base class pointers
* Polymorphism and interfaces
* `virtual` methods
<!-- Notes:
* virtual destructor!
-->

#### Lecture 8
* Abstract base classes
* Pure `virtual` methods
* Operator overriding
* `C++11` extension modules for `python`

#### Lecture 9
