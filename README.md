# SEAS `C`/`C++` Primer

This primer class is **voluntary and not graded**.  It will consist of lecture
components that teach you the essentials along with embedded hands-on exercises
that will take place interactively during class.  You are required to bring your
laptop and should have some intuition and comfort in using the command line
(know how to navigate, create files and directories as well as being able to
edit files with an editor or IDE of your choice). You will not be given homework
for this class.

The class consists of 10 lectures at 75 minutes duration.  These lectures will
be held in the evening to avoid possible conflicts with your schedule. A
previous class taken for either language or experience gathered through other
means may be helpful.

### Lecture Content

Lectures 1-4 discuss basic concepts that were first introduced in `C`.  Lectures
5-10 focus on `C++` specific language features that are not available in `C`.
